# GeneticExperiment
Dr. Novario is facing a problem with his genetic experiments.  There are multiple compounds in his genetic experiments, which he denotes from “a” to “z”.
He uses a machine to synthesize his compounds. After synthesizing the compounds the machine gives result in this format "aabbaadddc".
It is very difficult for dr. Novario to find out strength of each compound. If he can get his results in this format instead  "a4b2d3c1", it will be easier for him find out
strength on each element. 
Write a program to help Dr. Novario. The machine which gives result of compound synthesis works on one compound at a time which means it cannot emit jumbled characters like
aabbacac.
It can only emit aaaabbcc.
